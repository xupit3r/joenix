custom scripts/tools for my linux setup

## utils
will be written in Clojure (using [Babashka](https://book.babashka.org)) and Rust. should be a lot of fun!

available right now:
 * [clojure] simple weather utility that interacts with [Open Mateo](https://open-meteo.com/)
 * [rust] the start of a utility to interact with spotifyd...why not, right?
